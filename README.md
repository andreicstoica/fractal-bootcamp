# Fractal Bootcamp Work!

## About me 
Hi, my name is Andrei. I'm interested in how technology can help people directly, especialy as it relates to expression and the physical world. Having worked in tech for the last ~7 years, and having pursued an individualized major titled 'Human Computer Interaction and Ethical Innovation Systems,' I have experience in product, physical and digital design, sustainability, and political economy. I am most interested in the intersections of these domains.

## Why I quit my job to join the bootcamp
Long story! In short, I got disillusioned with the trajectory of my career and the sorts of projects I could realistically work on. I go into detail [in this blog I wrote](https://andreisthoughts.substack.com/p/why-im-quitting-my-job).

## Week 1
- Created a basic game (I picked Tic Tac Toe)
- Learned TailwindCSS, making pixel-perfect components from Figma designs
- Made my game run on a server (using vite-express)
